      <p class="final-text">
        Jackie Chan became an actor, producer, screenwriter, choreographer, film director, singer and honored expert in martial arts, with a lot of commitment, dedication, work and scars. In my opinion, a world reference in terms of dedication, just like Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Jackson and other people extremely focused on doing what they want to do well.
